    <h2>Introduction to Eren Yeager: The Relentless Hero of Attack on Titan</h2>
    <p><strong>Eren Jeager</strong> is the central protagonist of the anime and manga series "Attack on Titan", created by <em>Hajime Isayama</em>. Eren starts off as a determined and passionate young man, driven by a deep-seated desire to explore the world beyond the walls that confine humanity. His journey begins with a tragic event—the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother during a Titan attack—which ignites his quest for vengeance against the Titans.
       <br>  Eren's journey explores themes of freedom, sacrifice, and the moral ambiguities of war, making him a deeply complex and sometimes controversial figure within the series.</p><img id="img2" src="https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50129/1002564483/original/1002564483-photo-u2?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&w=375">
